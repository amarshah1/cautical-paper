\section{Conclusion}~\label{sec:conclusion}


PR clause learning is effective for learning short proofs for 
difficult problems. However, current PR clause learning techniques require
an NP-hard check. We solve this by providing a technique that learns PR clauses
in a linear time preprocessing step. We provide clause shrinking and filtering 
techniques to ensure that we learn useful PR clauses.

Our implementation, \tool, provides short \pr proofs for the pigeonhole principle matching the best possible results.
 While prior work is only effective on specific pigeonhole
encodings, \tool finds these proofs even when the formula is scranfilized.

Additionally, \tool is effective on a number of benchmarks from the SAT competition,
including most of the families identified in \autoref{subsec:eval-discussion}.

In the future, we hope that PR clause learning can find its way into the main branch
of a popular SAT solver. We believe this work is an effective step in this direction.
